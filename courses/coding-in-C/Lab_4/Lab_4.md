# Lab 4: Palindrome Detective

## Introduction
Write a C program that checks if a given word is a palindrome.  
A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., "level", "radar").

## Section I

### Requirements

1. Prompt the user to enter a word (maximum 100 characters).
2. Read the input safely into a character array.
3. Check if the word is a palindrome (case-sensitive).
4. Print the result in the following format:

Your provided word "WORD" is a palindrome.

or

Your provided word "WORD" is not a palindrome.

5. You can use other libraries e.g. string operations.

### Example

Please enter your word (max. 100 characters): radar

Your provided word "radar" is a palindrome.

## Section II

Adapt your program from section I so that it is case-insensitive.
